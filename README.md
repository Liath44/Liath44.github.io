# MonkiGame  
  
*In this game you would be beaten by a monkey (it's actually nothing to be worried about)*  
  
## I want to play. Now!  
  
Sure - [Here's the link](https://liath44.github.io/MonkiGame/)   
  
## Game goal  

Your goal is to complete as many rounds as possible. Each round  consists of two phases:

  * __Phase 1__ - In specified time you have to remember a sequence of randomly placed squares. Sequence is specified by numbers. If time runs out or you click a tile the game advances to __Phase 2__
  * __Phase 2__ - Your goal is to recreate the sequence by clicking the tiles in order presented in __Phase 1__. Achieving this goal will advance you to the next round where time for memorisation will be shorter and a new tile may be added. Failure will result in a game over (sad monkey noises)

## Options

Following game aspects can be customised in options:
  * Initial number of tiles to memorise
  * Initial time for memorisation
  * Time reduction per rounds
  * Chance to add an extra tile in between rounds

## Inspiration

Game inspired by Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University and their research on cognitive capabilities of chimpanzees.
